    <h1>Cologne</h1>
    <h2>The Invisible Architecture of Scent</h2>
    <p><em>January 27, 2026</em></p>
  </section> <br>

  <p>
    The first spray of cologne is sharp and immediate. 
    The scent rises quickly, filling the air with crisp notes that feel clean and energizing. 
    For a moment, it is bold and noticeable.
  </p>

  <p>
    As time passes, the fragrance begins to change, unfolding with <u>10 to 100+</u> different aromatic compounds.
    The sharpness softens into something smoother and warmer, settling closer to the skin. 
    Hints of <strong>weathered cedarwood, the dry heat of black pepper, and the earthy depth of musk</strong> replace the initial freshness. 
    These base notes anchor the scent, turning a fleeting mist into a lasting, calmer presence.
  </p> 

  <blockquote>
    -“A fragrance is a silent introduction.”
  </blockquote> <br>

  <p>
    Each bottle tells its own story before it is ever opened. 
    Some are heavy glass with dark colors, others are clear and minimal. 
    The weight of the bottle, the shape of the cap, and the click of the spray all add to the experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cologne does not stay in one place. 
    It lingers in the air, follows movement, and leaves a trace long after someone has passed by. 
    When applied lightly, it feels natural rather than overpowering.
  </p>

  <p>
    The best colognes are balanced. 
    They start strong, fade smoothly, remain subtle and noticeable only to those who are close enough to sense it.
