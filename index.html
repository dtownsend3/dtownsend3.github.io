    <p>Hello, world!</p>

    <h1>Just A Typical Day In South Bend</h1>
    <h2><i>January 27th, 2026</i></h2> <br>
</section>

<p>As you might know, in South Bend, Indiana, we don't do "mild" when it comes time for cold temperatures and snow.</p>

<p>I must say.. <strong>I am not a fan!</strong> I prefer the temperature to be warm outside. Is asking for the <mark>60's or 70's</mark> really too much to ask for? Apparently, the <strong><i>"National Weather Service"</i></strong> thinks so.</p>

<p>As I sit here in the classroom, I wonder, think, and type what is on my mind. I'm staring at the computer screen and thinking about the the last show I watched talking about the cold:</p>

<blockquote>
  <em>"Winter is coming, we know what's coming with it. We can learn to live with the wildlings, or we can add them to the army of the dead." 
  <br>— Jon Snow </em>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyways before I wrap up the thoughts on my mind, if I were writing a program to fix this, it would look like this:</p>
<code>if (temperature < 60) { state = "Nap Mode"; }</code>

<p><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> to save my sanity.</p>

<p>Best of luck if you are in SouthBend and stay warm!</p>
